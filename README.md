# ionic-sidemenu-vstools
This sample provides a version of the Ionic Starter Template for SideMenu that works with Visual Studio Tools for Apache Cordova, Android, iOS, and Windows targets.

This sample is based on the original Ionic sample at https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-starter-sidemenu

Some changes were made to support Windows targets. For info on changes made to the project to support Windows,
see this blog post: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/msdn_answers/archive/2015/02/10/running-cordova-apps-on-windows-and-windows-phone-8-1-using-ionic-angularjs-and-other-frameworks.aspx

### Requirements
Visual Studio 2015 RC with optional cross-platform components for HTML/JavaScript installed.

Note: In VS 2015 RC, project structure is updated for compatibility with 3rd party tools and CLIs. If you need to migrate an older version of an app based on this template to VS 2015 RC, see Known Issues (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=398782).

### Running The App
After you finish downloading and installing VS Tools for Apache Cordova (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=524433), open up the project in Visual Studio.

### Updates
- 05/04/15: Project structure updated for VS 2015 RC. This makes the project interoperable with the Ionic CLI.

### Known Issues
- When debugger is attached on Windows targets, you can get a WWAHost.exe runtime error on some VS installs.
   Issue is currently under investigation.
   Workaround: When targeting Win/WinPhone, use Start without Debugging (Alt+F5).
- The Android 4.3 browser has some known limitations, and so the sample may not work perfectly on such devices
